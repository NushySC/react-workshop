# CSS Debugging tips and tricks

This time we will focus on debugging CSS styles when working with React.
We will hunt down a few example bugs with browser Dev Tools Inspector and identify good ways how to fix them.
Vertical alignment, flexbox, animations, responsive designs, CSS-in-JS, overwriting default library styles and other useful tips await.
