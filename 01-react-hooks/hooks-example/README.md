## To run the application

If you've just downloaded the code and you are running the application
for the first time, go to the project directory and install all packages

```shell
npm ci
```

Then, you can run the app in the development mode:

```shell
npm start
```

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
