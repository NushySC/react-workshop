# To run the application

If you've just downloaded the code and you are running the application
for the first time, go to the project directory and install all packages

```shell
npm ci
```

Then, you can run the app in the development mode:

```shell
npm start
```

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
